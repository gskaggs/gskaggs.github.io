These two eating paradigms are complete opposites. One would almost require you eat a high carb and relatively low protein and fat diet. The other would have you eat loads of fat and protein, while minimizing carbs as much as possible. The fact that I've tested and been successful for prolonged periods on both of these eating frameworks is a testament to both the adaptability of my digestive system, as well as the magnitude of my stubbornness and curiosity.

### TL;DR

When I was vegan, I was arrogant, insufferable, and outrageously self-indulgent. I'm still all those things of course, but at least I'm not still vegan.

### Veganism

During my senior year of high school I began what would be nine months on the vegan diet. During that time I loved eating all the fruits and veggies, as well as my favorite cereals and other carb-loaded foods. I got my protein from beans and lentils, although this had the unfortunate side effect of turning me into a gastrointestinal-induced olfactory nightmare—much to the dismay of my college roommate at the time.

In general I felt very healthy although I did have to worry about my levels of B12 and other micro nutrients. In fact I got my blood tested towards the end of my nine months. (Everything came back healthy.) In the end I came off the vegan diet after joining the UT rowing team since I found it to be difficult to get the calories I needed to lift weights and row everyday, especially on the dorm food provided at UT.

### Keto

My experience with the keto diet began about eight months ago when I moved back in with my dad due to the Corona pandemic. My dad's on the keto diet, and I thought it'd be convenient and fun for me to go along with him during my stay here.

On the positive side I find that I'm much less hungry throughout the day and that my energy levels are more stable, probably due to my blood sugar being more consistent while I'm in ketosis. This has likely had a great effect on my comfort levels when experimenting with intermittent fasting and OMAD.

On the flip side though, in my opinion what I’m eating just doesn't feel as healthy overall, especially when I'm eating fatty animal products like pork rinds. Additionally, I find it very easy to gain weight on the keto diet if I don't track my caloric intake carefully. I very much enjoy the food I’m eating, but it's worth noting I have to eat less frequently so as to avoid overfeeding. (I should also note here that it's certainly the case that many people find that they lose weight on this diet because there are less hungry and are eating less often. Weight-loss just hasn't been my experience.)

### Bonus

Here's a sample day of eating that I logged on the keto diet:

Lunch:
