# Some Practical Thoughts on Iroh's Big Questions

<hr>

`I’m a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change — Polo G`

Some people are killers.

<p style="text-align:right;">Others aren’t.</p>

Western culture places immense importance on staying true to oneself. And for good reason. The alternative is a false life, in disharmony with one’s own values and dispositions.

Yet the journey to understanding one’s own identity and character doesn’t always feel easy or obvious. In the case of Prince Zuko, it was painful and difficult and resulted in my favorite character arc in *Avatar: The Last Airbender.*

<p style="text-align:center"> 
`It’s time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions:` <br> `Who are you?` <br> `And what do **you** want?`
</p>

My intent in this post, then, is not to give a definitive answer to Iroh's omnipresent questions: *Who am I? And what do I want?* Instead, I’d like to share a psychological framework I’ve found to provide some practical, if incomplete, answers. 

Recorded at the University of Toronto and since [posted on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi), Jordan Peterson’s *Personality and its Transformations* course first dives deep into the great psychoanalytic thinkers like Freud, Jung, and Rogers. Then Peterson examines **The Big Five Traits.** These traits constitute the most widely accepted personality theory in modern psychology and, for me at least, created a paradigm shift in how I view myself and others. 

Easily remembered with the acronym OCEAN, the five traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. 

*Note: Instead of explaining each member of the Big Five framework, I'll link [this article](https://www.simplypsychology.org/big-five-personality.html) by Simply Psychology which does an excellent job.*

The theory blew my mind for a couple reasons:

1. Unlike Buzzfeed's *What brand of pre-teen ketchup am I?* quizzes, the traits finally provided a satisfying means of evaluating my own personality. I quickly identified myself as high in Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. 
1. I began to admire positive traits others had in quantities that I didn’t. Consequently, I was motivated to invest time and energy cultivating curiosity, creativity, and extraversion.
1. I had the giddy nostalgia of being reminded of Pokemon stats from the video games I used to play as a kid:
