### About

Transforming normal photographs into aesthetic pixel art. That's Pyxeled. Inspired by the paper [Pixelated Image Abstraction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2330147.2330154) by Gerstner et al., this application leverages intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally render images at lower resolutions and limited color palettes.

All the code for Pyxeled is freely available on [its public GitHub repository.](https://github.com/gskaggs/Pyxeled).

### How it works

Pixel art derives its iconic aesthetic from two fundamental artistic constraints: lower resolution and a limited color palette. That is, both the number of pixels and the number of distinct colors present in the end product should be minimal. When converting a normal image into pixel art, Pyxeled must deal with both of these constraints. It does so by the use of two intelligent clustering algorithms.

First, we use Simple Linear Interative Clustering (SLIC) to help preserve image features while dropping resolution. Each iteration of SLIC involves clustering input pixels into groups called super-pixels. These super-pixels represent the pixels of our output image and are spaced roughly evenly throughout the input image.

To optimally assign colors to these super-pixels while maintaining the constraint of limited palette size, we use a second clustering algorithm called Mass Constrained Deterministic Annealing (MCDA). This algorithm is significantly more complicated than SLIC and is based on the way atomic particles interact and bond as the temperature of a sytem is lowered. More precisely, each super-pixel represents a particle and each color in our palette represents a cluster of these particles. Initially, there is a high temperature in our system and thus the super-pixels are not clustered in any meaningful way. However, as time progresses we simulate the way clusters form as the temperature lowers.

Crucially, each iteration of our algorithm involves an application of both SLIC and MCDA. Effectivley, this allows the formation of the superpixels to adapt as MCDA converges on an optimal color palatte. Graphically, this process is depicted in the following image taken from _Pixelated Image Abstraction:_
