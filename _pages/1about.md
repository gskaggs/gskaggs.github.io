In 2018, I graduated valedictorian from [Clear Lake High School](https://clearlakehs.ccisd.net/) (CLHS) where I played trumpet in the marching band and symphony orchestra. During my time at CLHS, I performed with the Houston Youth Symphony, was captain of the Science Olympiad team, and was elected Homecoming King of my senior class.
