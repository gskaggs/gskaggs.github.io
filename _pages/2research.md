Currently, I'm doing research with [Dr. David Harwath](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~harwath/) at UT Austin, pursuing applications of machine learning to speech and language processing in a multimodal context.

In the summer of 2019, I did research under [Dr. Calvin Lin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/) at the intersection of computer achitecture and ML, exploring the use of LSTM networks to prefetch cache memory addresses.
