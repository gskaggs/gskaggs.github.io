      "content"  : "These two eating paradigms are complete opposites. One would almost require you eat a high carb and relatively low protein and fat diet. The other would have you eat loads of fat and protein, while minimizing carbs as much as possible. The fact that I’ve tested and been successful for prolonged periods on both of these eating frameworks is a testament to both the adaptability of my digestive system, as well as the magnitude of my stubbornness and curiosity.TL;DRWhen I was vegan, I was arrogant, insufferable, and outrageously self-indulgent. I’m still all those things of course, but at least I’m not still vegan.VeganismDuring my senior year of high school I began what would be nine months on the vegan diet. During that time I loved eating all the fruits and veggies, as well as my favorite cereals and other carb-loaded foods. I got my protein from beans and lentils, although this had the unfortunate side effect of turning me into a gastrointestinal-induced olfactory nightmare—much to the dismay of my college roommate at the time.In general I felt very healthy although I did have to worry about my levels of B12 and other micro nutrients. In fact I got my blood tested towards the end of my nine months. (Everything came back healthy.) In the end I came off the vegan diet after joining the UT rowing team since I found it to be difficult to get the calories I needed to lift weights and row everyday, especially on the dorm food provided at UT.KetoMy experience with the keto diet began about eight months ago when I moved back in with my dad due to the Corona pandemic. My dad’s on the keto diet, and I thought it’d be convenient and fun for me to go along with him during my stay here.On the positive side I find that I’m much less hungry throughout the day and that my energy levels are more stable, probably due to my blood sugar being more consistent while I’m in ketosis. This has likely had a great effect on my comfort levels when experimenting with intermittent fasting and OMAD.On the flip side though, in my opinion what I’m eating just doesn’t feel as healthy overall, especially when I’m eating fatty animal products like pork rinds. Additionally, I find it very easy to gain weight on the keto diet if I don’t track my caloric intake carefully. I very much enjoy the food I’m eating, but it’s worth noting I have to eat less frequently so as to avoid overfeeding. (I should also note here that it’s certainly the case that many people find that they lose weight on this diet because there are less hungry and are eating less often. Weight-loss just hasn’t been my experience.)BonusHere’s a sample day of eating that I logged on the keto diet:Lunch:  Beef chuck roast 1/2 lb - 420 cal  Almonds 21 g - 128 cal  Medium tomato 1/2 - 6 cal  Poblano pepper 17 g - 12 calDinner:  Ground beef chuck (80/20) 1.2 lb - 1400 cal  Lettuce 1 cup - 14 cal  Yellow onion 0.2 cup - 16 cal  Medium tomato 1/2 - 6 cal  Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter 2 tablespoons - 180 cal  Almonds 7 g - 42 calTotal: 2280 caloriesMacronutrient breakdown (percent total calories):  Carbohydrates 26 g - 5%  Fat 168 g - 67%  Protein 157 g - 28%",

And wow, in this memoir he has some stories to tell - stories which entertain and inspire and astound.Personal Key Takeaways:  Take more risks.  Live life, have exciting experiences: “The art of livin”  Journal during the good times and the bad.  Don’t be impressed with your life, be involved in it.  Don’t need it. Want it.  Never half-ass it.  Know who you are and own it.If you’re on the edge about this book, I recommend checking out Tim Ferriss’ interview with McConaughey. It’s exceptionally well done and provides a good taste of the book’s flavor.The Chronicles of NarniaC. S. LewisDate read: November 2020 Strength of recommendation: 7 / 10 This month I listened to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as well as Prince Caspian on Audible. I enjoyed analyzing the stories’ Christian symbolism and marveling at Lewis’ fantastic imagination.The Name of the WindPatrick RothfussDate read: October 2020 Strength of recommendation: 7 / 10  AmazonThe Name of the Wind scratched my fantasy itch perfectly and reminded me of so many childhood hours spent reading Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. Big thanks to my wonderful aunt and uncle for gifting this book to me.The Name of the Wind appears to have polarized reviews on Amazon: many people simply love it; others simply don’t. As a piece of entertainment, I found the book to absolutely deliver. I would listen to the audiobook for hours at a time, to the undeniable detriment of my homework routine. However, this may say more about my love for a good fantasy novel than the quality of the actual book, and any number of perfectly valid gripes can be made about it:  Amazingly, characters in this book suffer head trauma and black out on at least 4 occasions.  The dragons are vegetarians…  The principle antagonists of the main character are (1) his poverty, which was compelling initially but soon became repetitive and (2) a mythical people that he never confronts and really never learns anything about the whole book.  The main character’s friends don’t play hugely meaningful roles in his development.  The main character’s major love interest is capricious to the point of infuriation.Some lessons I’m thinking about after reading The Name of the Wind:  Virtue is something you practice, not something you signal.  Curiosity is an incredibly valuable asset and motivator.  We are spoiled to live in an age with such freely available means of communication and information.Murder on the Orient ExpressAgatha ChristieDate read: September 2020 Strength of recommendation: 8 / 10  Amazon / AudibleI loved the wit and cunning of detective Hercule Poirot and was overall greatly enchanted by this classic mystery. Additionally, I highly recommend the audiobook version which brilliantly brought to life Christie’s cast of colorful characters.LifespanDavid SinclairDate read: September 2020 Strength of recommendation: 9 / 10  Amazon pageAn important book. One which I believe can and will redefine the way we view aging and longevity. Shout-out to my wonderful friend Ian for gifting this to me as a Christmas present.Although this book contains a wealth of information, here are some of my key takeaways:In his Information Theory of Aging, Sinclair places surprising importance on epigenetics and sirtuins. Basically, he reasons that DNA damage disrupts the epigenome which results in loss of cell identity and then cellular senescence. This in turn causes disease and death in the organism.A widely scientifically accepted way to improve lifespan in most animals and humans is to practice calorie reduced diets and/or fasting. Putting these type of pressures on the body triggers your “survival circuit,” a physiological response characterized by “[boosted] cellular defenses” and the “[minimization] of epigenetic change.”Several other means exist to trigger your survival circuit, including restricting amino acid consumption (e.g. by eating less meat) and exposure to cold.Regular exercise has been shown to increase telomere length in humans.A number of drugs have been found to increase longevity in animals and humans, most notably metformin and resveratrol. Interestingly, resveratrol is found in red wines and may be considered a product of “stressed” grapes undergoing there own survival circuits.Looking to the future, Sinclair suggests we get accustomed to the idea that humans may one day expect to live well past 100. In which case we should reconsider any number of current economic, political, and social systems which presuppose a normal retirement age. For instance, with a thriving older population, we may have new perspectives on political term limits, social security, vacations and mini-retirements, and education later in life.Dropping Ashes on the BuddhaSeung SahnDate read: September 2020 Strength of recommendation: 8 / 10  Amazon pageZen Master Seung Sang is entertaining, eccentric, and immensely thought-provoking. I loved his introduction to Zen Buddhist thought, which he tells through letters, stories, and accounts of his teachings.  “If a person came and asked you ‘What is Buddha?’, what would your answer be?” The student said, “Dry shit on a stick.” Soen-sa said, “Oh, very good. Now one more question. Zen Master Dong Sahn said, ‘Buddha is three pounds of flax.’ Are this answer and the other answer the same or different?” The student hit the floor. Soen-sa said, “I don’t believe you.” The student said, “Birds fly in the sky, fish swim in the water.” Soen-sa said, “This is scratching your left foot when your right foot itches.” The student bowed and left.I thought this quote provides a nice taste of the philosophy featured in Dropping Ashes on the Buddha. Here, both the student and Zen Master acknowledge the inherent limitations of human language. This is why (1) they call the Buddha several things which are both meaningless and possibly offensive and (2) the student responds with silence to the master’s question about sameness. The student’s words about the birds and fish go to a deeper level of Zen Buddhist thought, one in which the thinker recognizes the true nature of the world is simply what is. However, Soen-sa is still dissatisfied. When the Zen Master says “This is scratching your left foot when your right foot itches,” he indicates that though the student did well, he did not adequately provide an answer to the question “What is the Buddha?”Never Split the DifferenceChris VossDate read: August 2020 Strength of recommendation: 8 / 10  Amazon pageFormer FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss shows you the ins and outs of his craft. This short book is immediately practical and highly engaging.Highly logical negotiation theory fails because humans are irrational and emotional.Voss’ tools are designed to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, illicit verbalization of needs. We understand that people want to be understood and accepted, so we listen intensely to show empathy. The result is that our opponents become less aggressive and more open-minded.Assumptions blind, hypotheses guide. Good negotiators know they need to be ready for surprises. Great negotiators use their skills to reveal the surprises they’re certain exist.The less important your counterpart makes himself using “we/us” pronouns the more important he probably is in his team’s decision making process.There are three voices you should consider when negotiating:  The FM DJ voice: a self-assured voice of calm and reason  A positive playful voice: Use most of the time, encourages positivity and cooperation  Am assertive dominant voice: Use with cautionMirroring leverages the concept of “birds of a feather flock together.” You send subtle signals that you’re similar to your counterpart and should be bonded with. Seen often in body language. Voss’ recommendation: Continually repeat the last three words of what your counterpart just said.In one study the tip for waiters who mirrored (In this case, that means repeated the customers’ orders back to them.) was something like 70% more than those who used praise (e.g. “no problem, great”).Labeling: a type of tactical empathy; understanding your opponents emotions, articulating them, and respectfully verbalizing them.This is a great way to calm down scared or nervous people. By getting their anxiety in the open, you defuse it.Labels always begin with “it seems like,” “it sounds like,” or “it looks like.”Doing an accusation audit before a meeting can help identify possible labels. This entails identifying all the reasons your counterpart might be angry with you.Always give your counterpart the opportunity to say no. Don’t demand, collaborate.There are 3 kinds of yes:  Counterfeit  Confirmation  CommitmentThe power of no:Yes can be inauthentic. When a person says no, they feel in control and not just being taken for a ride. For example, always ask “Is now a bad time?” instead of “Is now a good time?” If you get a no, you know the person is going to be focused and not just distractedly playing along.In general, that’s right is a great sign. It signals your counterpart believes they’ve come up with a solution or idea themselves.Alternatively, you’re right is bad and often dismissive.Use your opponent’s deadlines against them. Cars salesman are more likely to give good deals at end of the month, businessmen at end of the financial quarter.Remember that deadlines cut both ways. Let your opponents know your deadline and they’ll feel the pressure too.We may use reason to guide us toward decisions. But the actual decision making is always emotional.Certainty effect: people will chose a certain outcome over a risky one even if payoff is likely to be less.Loss aversion is hugely important for both marketing and negotiation.Avoid anchoring (giving the first offer) in monetary bargaining. But beware of sharks who will give a ludicrous anchor to throw you off.Numbers which end in 0 feel like placeholders. When bargaining try to use odd, precise numbers to close the deal.Principle of Reciprocity: after a tough offer, give a non-monetary gift. The person will feel the need to repay.In a job interview or salary negotiation, ask “what does it take to be successful here.” That’ll give the boss a personal stake in your success. Additionally, you’ve possibly just created an unofficial mentor.The trick to negotiating is getting your counterpart to solve your problems without them noticing. Ask questions like “how am I supposed to do that?” Now they understand your problem and will instinctively try to help.These should be open “reporter questions” which start with what or how.Very common example What is the greatest challenge you face? What about this is important to you? How can I help to make this better for us? How would you like to proceed? How can we solve this problem? What are we trying to accomplish here? How am I supposed to do that?In these questions you want with the other guy to think you need to use his intelligence. This diverts your opponents emotional and mental resources towards your goal and also moves them away from their adversarial state.Who has control in a negotiation the talker or the listener? The listener of course. That’s because the talker is revealing information.We call these questions “calibrated questions.” We call their effect “forced empathy.”Two key questions to make your counterpart feel like they are building their own solution: How will we know we’re on track? How do we address things if we’re off track?The 7/38/55 rule states that 7% of what we communicate is done so through the verbal word, 35% is through the tone and intonation, and 55% is through our body language.Four ways to say no:  How am I supposed to do that?  Thank you for your generous offer but that just doesn’t work for me.  I’m sorry but I just can’t do that.  I’m sorry, no.There are three types of negotiators:  Assertives  Accommodaters  AnalystsA good negotiator knows how to be themselves at the bargaining table. A great negotiator adds to their strengths by understanding their weaknesses.Ackerman Bargaining System (Quoted directly from the book):  Set your target price (your goal).  Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.  Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).  Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.  When calculating the final amount, use precise, non round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.  On your final number, throw in a non monetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.DraculaBram StokerDate read: August 2020 Strength of recommendation: 8 / 10  Amazon page / AudibleExquisite. Audible’s ensemble cast brilliantly performs Stoker’s horrific classic.The Selfish GeneRichard DawkinsDate read: July 2020 Strength of recommendation: 9 / 10  Amazon pageDawkins explores economic and evolutionary theory to explain the interplay of selfishness and altruism in nature. Worth reading alone for the incredible descriptions of regicidal insect colonies, game-theoretic fig trees, and the first ever use of the word meme.In one sense, Darwin’s “survival of the fittest” may be rephrased as “survival of the stable.” Applied to the chaotic origins of life and DNA, this modification rings particularly true. In these primeval conditions, the simple replicators which preceded modern genetic material did well if they possessed three qualities. First longevity, they did not easily breakdown. Second fecundity, they replicated quickly. And third accuracy, they replicated with minimal error.Dawkins defines a gene as: any portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection.Dawkins defines an Evolutionary Stable Strategy or ESS as: a strategy which, if most members of a species adopt it, cannot be beaten by another strategy. Such a strategy may very well be encoded genetically and may therefore be subject to the same Darwinian analysis as any other phenotype.Consider for example, the practice of cuckoo birds to parasite the nests of other species. This qualifies as an ESS since any cuckoo born without genetic encoding to employ this strategy would be at a certain disadvantage and ultimately its genes would not prevail over the majority.In biological terms, the fundamental difference between males and females is that male gametes are smaller and more numerous than the gametes of females. The consequences of this asymmetry are many and profound. One is that males may be more likely to abandon their children in favor of pursuing other mates. To combat such behavior, females of several species evolved to either a) play coy, forcing males to invest more time and energy in the process of mate-finding or b) choose to mate with the strongest, most environmentally fit males regardless his potentially improbable honesty.Naked mole rats organize themselves similarly to social insects like bees and ants. In fact, in any given mole rate colony only one female (the queen) breeds, and the vast majority of work is done by sterile individuals called workers.Some species of ants wage war on and kidnap the eggs of other ant colonies. Once hatched these eggs are kept as the unwitting slaves of the aggressor ants. Even as they mature into adult worker ants, these slaves remain unaware that they serve a foreign species.Dawkins defines memes as: units of cultural transmission. These are the new replicators. The ideas, songs, fashions, catch-phrases which abound in the evolving soup of human culture.We can apply the same analysis of longevity, fecundity, and replication accuracy to memes. Additionally, we note that memes which do well are often psychologically appealing.The fundamental principle necessary for memes to existence in a population is the capability of individuals to mimic one-another. In fact, the songs which live and mutate within populations of some bird species qualify as memes.A parasite may transport its genes via the same vehicle as its host, i.e. through the host’s gametes in sexual reproduction. If this is the case, then the parasite has everything to gain by helping its host to survive and procreate, and over evolutionary time will cease to be a parasite at all.In the ant species Bothriomyrmex regicides and B. decapitans, the queen sneaks into a foreign colony, assassinates via decapitation the rival queen, and then presides over the workers who unsuspectingly tend to her eggs and larvae. Over time her children will outnumber and replace the workers of the previous species. Some will fly to other colonies and repeat the regicidal ritual.Fireflies attract their mates by flashing particular sequences of lights. The genus Photuris has evolved to mimic the flashing pattern of genus Photinus. In doing so, the females of the former attract and then devour the males of the latter.American GodsNeil GaimanDate read: July 2020 Strength of recommendation: 8 / 10  Amazon pageA thrilling novel. Gaiman employs gods old and new, providing deep insight into America and the nature of human belief.A Room with a ViewE. M. ForsterDate read: June 2020 Strength of recommendation: 6 / 10  Amazon pageAlthough I appreciated Forster’s beautiful prose and the positive spirit of his ultimately feminist message, I couldn’t help but feel the central romance of this novel has become, at least for a modern reader, predictable almost to the point of cliche.  There is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.Above our heads is the heavenly ideal. It is that which we look up to with our aspirations and good intentions, that which we try to bring about in this world.  Men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.Taken with the previous quote, perhaps Forster is suggesting that men either care for seeing and doing what is right in the world or they reject and forget these ideals altogether.  “Life” wrote a friend of mine, “is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.”Travels with Charley in Search of AmericaJohn SteinbeckDate read: June 2020 Strength of recommendation: 7 / 10  Amazon pageSteinbeck’s road trip across America with his French poodle Charley makes for a charming and enjoyable read.  So I drove up the mountain and found a dairy, bought some milk, and asked permission to camp under an apple tree. The dairy man had a Ph.D. in mathematics, and he must have had some training in philosophy. He liked what he was doing and he didn’t want to be somewhere else - one of the very few content people I met in my whole journey.I’d like to imagine this figure as a living specimen of the archetypal old wise man, contented to live a life of simplicity.  He put my sins in a new perspective. Whereas they had been small and mean and nasty and best forgotten, this minister gave them some size and bloom and dignity… I wasn’t a naughty child but a first rate sinner.  …  All across the country I went to church on Sundays, a different denomination every week, but nowhere did I find the quality of that Vermont preacher. He forged a religion designed to last, not predigested obsolescence.There’s something deeply unsatisfying about the idea that one’s sins are of little or no consequence. To instead recognize the human propensity to do real terrible evil gives meaning to one’s actions, and simultaneously makes indisputable not only one’s capacity, but one’s necessity, to do good in the world.  Like most Americans I am no lover of cops, and the consistent investigation of city forces for bribery, brutality, and a long picturesque list of malfeasances is not designed to reassure me.Reading this in a book published in 1962 sobered me to what difficult, fundamental, and longlasting problems police brutality and corruption are, especially in light of the now recent murder of George Floyd.NeverwhereNeil GaimanDate read: May 2020 Strength of recommendation: 7 / 10  Amazon pageA fun book, though unlikely to be remembered as Gaiman’s greatest work.DuneFrank HerbertDate read: April 2020 Strength of recommendation: 9 / 10  Amazon pageA masterpiece of world-building and story. I found myself listening to the audiobook for hours into the night, lost in Herbert’s fiction.Zen and the Art of Motorcycle MaintenanceRobert M. PirsigDate read: April 2020 Strength of recommendation: 10 / 10  Amazon pageA philosophical dive into the intersection of rationality, intuition, and values. This work greatly shaped the way I see Eastern and Western thought.Can’t Hurt MeDavid GogginsDate read: March 2020 Strength of recommendation: 10 / 10  Amazon pageThe only audiobook I’ve ever listened to a second time as soon as I finished the first. Goggins overcame child abuse, poverty, and small-town racism to go on to lose over a 100 lbs and become a celebrated Navy SEAL and ultramarathon runner. Absolutely inspirational.The Art of LearningJosh WaitzkinDate read: March 2020 Strength of recommendation: 9 / 10  Amazon pageWaitzkin provides a wealth of wisdom in the space of high performance psychology. My second time reading this book.Bonus: Spanish Titles  Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal, J. K.

      "content"  : "He died at age 87, most probably due to the cancer in his lungs. Aside from that, I knew very little of the man who lay before me. And yet, after many hours laboring over his body, dissecting and excavating, our little team of five or six volunteers got to know him in an unusually intimate way. Over the course of three days, we removed and uncovered brains and muscles, intestines and fat. Most of us first-time dissectors, we followed the instructions of our leader, a third-year student at Dell Medical School named Thomas Varkey.Thomas is a close friend, and the principle investigator of the pupilometer project I worked on this summer. He boasts more experience than most with human dissections. Granted, on the surface, this is a potentially disturbing thought. But not when you consider what these fossilized anatomies are used for. Saving the city several thousands of dollars, his work helps provide an invaluable resource to train hundreds of Austin’s EMS responders.Of the three days allocated to the dissection, I came only to the first. That Friday evening, I walked into a room cold and sterile, filled with the smell of ethanol. Noticeably devoid of grief and repulsion, the team worked instead in steady concentration, following closely to the instructions of Thomas, who would often pause to explain different anatomical facts and curiosities to volunteers and observers.My first task was to remove the flesh and connective tissue covering the man’s skull. I did this with scalpel and tweezers, a slow but necessary process, somewhat akin to peeling a large and disgustingly pallid orange. Once I finished with that, my roommate Ian and I were able to remove the top of the man’s skull with a bone saw, thereby exposing the brain.I knew then, and I know now, that so long as I live I will never forget the burning putrid smell of a man’s skull being sawed off. Nor will I forget the image of my roommate using chisel and hammer to pry at the dead man’s cranium.Least likely of all, though, will I forget the delicate feeling of a man’s brain in my hands. Smaller and heavier than I expected, it was a wet wrinkly mass, a four pound miracle of neurons and glia. It was a man’s life. And it was in my palms.At one time it contained 87 years of memories and experiences. Among its halls had walked pain and pleasure, surprise and delight, sorrow and horror.That night I learned from a renowned neuro-immunologist about the cerebellum and the pons, about the frontal, temporal, and occidental lobes. He told us about myelin sheathes and the Nodes of Ranvier, and about multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by the degeneration of these important structures. He told us war stories from his career battling this and other neurological ailments.Later that night, and even through the week after, I felt a surprising sense of peace. Dissecting the dead man’s body made me more comfortable with my own mortality. I worked with a team who approached the corpse with only curiosity, concentration, and excitement. My fellow volunteers didn’t hesitate to joke about the man’s skinny legs or flat butt. We didn’t blink when bits of brain and skull landed on our scrubs and shoes. Afterwards was only the calm satisfaction of a job well done. Of all the takeaways and memories from this experience I hope most strongly that I retain this comfort with my personal mortality. ",

And for good reason. The alternative is a false life, in disharmony with one’s own values and dispositions.Yet the journey to understanding one’s own identity and character doesn’t always feel easy or obvious. In the case of Prince Zuko, it was painful and difficult and resulted in my favorite character arc in Avatar: The Last Airbender. `It’s time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions:`  `Who are you?`  `And what do **you** want?`My intent in this post, then, is not to give a definitive answer to Iroh’s omnipresent questions: Who am I? And what do I want? Instead, I’d like to share a psychological framework I’ve found to provide some practical, if incomplete, answers.Recorded at the University of Toronto and since posted on YouTube, Jordan Peterson’s Personality and its Transformations course first dives deep into the great psychoanalytic thinkers like Freud, Jung, and Rogers. Then Peterson examines The Big Five Traits. These traits constitute the most widely accepted personality theory in modern psychology and, for me at least, created a paradigm shift in how I view myself and others.Easily remembered with the acronym OCEAN, the five traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.Note: Instead of explaining each member of the Big Five framework, I’ll link this article by Simply Psychology which does an excellent job.The theory blew my mind for a couple reasons:  Unlike Buzzfeed’s What brand of pre-teen ketchup am I? quizzes, the traits finally provided a satisfying means of evaluating my own personality. I quickly identified myself as high in Conscientiousness and Agreeableness.  I began to admire positive traits others had in quantities that I didn’t. Consequently, I was motivated to invest time and energy cultivating curiosity, creativity, and extraversion.  I had the giddy nostalgia of being reminded of Pokemon stats from the video games I used to play as a kid:",

      "content"  : "Genetic Algorithms for…I recently discovered Evolution of Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Strategies with Different History Lengths in Static and Cultural Environments by Brunauer and Mayer. This paper uses genetic algorithms to produce effective strategies for the iterated prisoner’s dilemma.In economics, the iterated prisoner’s dilemma is a game in which players repeatedly engage in episodes of the classic prisoner’s dilemma. As in high stakes Uno, players do well if they navigate the treacherous waters of betrayal and cooperation. Unlike in the original prisoner’s dilemma, an optimal rational strategy here is by no means obvious.Brunauer and Mayer represent each player as a single chromosome where every “gene” encodes how the agent should act after a particular history of moves played. The length of history used varies from 1 to 6 moves, which in the latter case demands chromosomes containing several thousand genes. To “evolve” these players, the authors test each generation of chromosomes against classic strategies. They make sure chromosomes which perform well are more likely to pass their genes on to subsequent generations—although they also introduce some amount of variation through genetic mutation and crossover.After simulating several thousand generations, Brunauer and Mayer demonstrated the dominance of their evolved champions against more traditional static strategies.Over the past couple weeks I replicated the experiments of Brunauer and Mayer. My implementation differs from theirs in the parameters used for the genetic algorithms and in the exact adversarial classical strategies used to test the fitness of genetic agents. Additionally, I coded all the tournament and genetic code in Python instead of using external libraries. However, interestingly my results corroborated theirs in that longer history lengths did not necessarily improve performance.Feel free to browse my source code and archived results in the project’s public GitHub repository.Favorite ResourcesBefore this summer, I had reasonable familiarity with that classic of game theory—the prisoner’s dilemma. However, not until I read Richard Dawkins’ The Selfish Gene did I begin to appreciate the incredible far-reach of this little thought experiment.In the book’s twelfth chapter, playfully entitled “Nice Guys Finish First,” Dawkins explains several natural instances of evolved cooperation as the prisoner’s dilemma in disguise. Many commonplace interactions—the grooming habits of birds, how wasps pollinate fig trees, humanity’s symbiotic relationship with its gut bacteria—turn out to be games where cooperation and defection may mean life or death for evolutionary players, and the individuals who do best are often those most deftly evolved to navigate the paradoxical dilemma.The natural world often differs from the dilemma’s usual penal context in an important fundamental way. Unlike prisoners at risk of long jail sentences, two individuals within a bird or chimp population may have the opportunity to mutually cooperate many times. At each meeting they may identify their neighbor and remember his past tendency to betray. Unsurprisingly, we call the resultant strategetic paradigm the iterated prisoner’s dilemma.Researchers have gone to great lengths exploring strategies for this variant of the classic game. Stanford’s encyclopedia of philosophy summarizes the literature on this and other variants of the prisoner’s dilemma in its fascinating entry on the topic.Of particular interest to me is the relatively recent research applying machine learning to generate or assess strategies for the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Martin Kies in his paper Finding Best Answers for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma Using Improved Q-Learning provides an excellent literature review in this space.",

      "content"  : "Beautiful Pixel Art Powered by Machine Learning                        AboutTransforming normal photographs into aesthetic pixel art. That’s Pyxeled. Inspired by the paper Pixelated Image Abstraction by Gerstner et al., this application leverages intelligent clustering algorithms to optimally render images at lower resolutions and limited color palettes.All the code for Pyxeled is freely available on its public GitHub repository..How it worksPixel art derives its iconic aesthetic from two fundamental artistic constraints: lower resolution and a limited color palette. That is, both the number of pixels and the number of distinct colors present in the end product should be minimal. When converting a normal image into pixel art, Pyxeled must deal with both of these constraints. It does so by the use of two intelligent clustering algorithms.First, we use Simple Linear Interative Clustering (SLIC) to help preserve image features while dropping resolution. Each iteration of SLIC involves clustering input pixels into groups called super-pixels. These super-pixels represent the pixels of our output image and are spaced roughly evenly throughout the input image.To optimally assign colors to these super-pixels while maintaining the constraint of limited palette size, we use a second clustering algorithm called Mass Constrained Deterministic Annealing (MCDA). This algorithm is significantly more complicated than SLIC and is based on the way atomic particles interact and bond as the temperature of a sytem is lowered. More precisely, each super-pixel represents a particle and each color in our palette represents a cluster of these particles. Initially, there is a high temperature in our system and thus the super-pixels are not clustered in any meaningful way. However, as time progresses we simulate the way clusters form as the temperature lowers.Crucially, each iteration of our algorithm involves an application of both SLIC and MCDA. Effectivley, this allows the formation of the superpixels to adapt as MCDA converges on an optimal color palatte. Graphically, this process is depicted in the following image taken from Pixelated Image Abstraction:If you think Pyxeled is cool, you might also enjoy this fun blog post from Google AI on applying deep learning to transfer style between images.",

      "content"  : "Since starting my degree in computer science, several of my friends and family have asked for advice on getting started with programming, and in particular, getting started with Python programming. In this post I compiled a list of resources and strategies I would recommend to any beginner learning the language.&lt;hr&gt;1. Start with CodingBatCodingBat provides an invaluable supply of simple programming puzzles. Users create their own accounts and can see their progress as they work through the fundamentals of Python syntax and logic. When I taught programming last summer, I had students do several problems from each section as homework and left the rest to be done at the student’s discretion.On this site, I urge you to pause after achieving each correct solution. Programming is a craft, and you should constantly ask yourself: how could I have coded this more concisely? How could I make this solution simpler? How could I have solved the problem faster?If you’re having trouble getting started, make sure to check out CodingBat’s example code and tutorials here.2. Practice with Competition and Interview ProblemsNote that for the casual programmer, this section might be unnecessary, as the fundamentals acquired in step 1 may be sufficient for your purposes. If this is the case, feel free to skip to step 3.Soon CodingBat problems will become too easy. At this point I’d recommend checking out USACO, Hacker Rank, and LeetCode for challenging competitive programming and interview problems. Here you’ll learn more advanced data structures and gain valuable exposure to the algorithmic demands central to software engineering and computer science.If you’re particularly interested in preparing for technical interviews, I’d recommend the classic texts: Elements of Programming Interviews and Cracking the Coding Interview.3. Run with ItNow’s the time to jump right in. You know functions, datatypes, if statements, for loops, classes, and objects? Then you probably know enough to start working on whatever projects you find exciting. Maybe you’re interested in neural networks. Or video games. Or statistics for biomedical research. Find some tutorials and get coding!For inspiration check out Pyxeled, an application I programmed in Python to convert regular images into pixel art.4. TeachAs mentioned briefly in the first section, I taught Python programming last summer. For four weeks, in addition to the research I was doing at UT, I lectured a few hours each day at a Chinese school in Austin. Until then I had no prior formal education or work experience with Python. However, that summer mentoring these younger students burned into me both the fundamentals and elusive idiosyncrasies of the language. When you’ve reached an appropriate proficiency with Python, I highly recommend tutoring other students or friends who are learning the language.5. Google EverythingThis last one’s a warning: Be prepared to Google.A lot.Everything.How do I reverse an array in Python? Beats me, Google it.What’s the difference between Python versions 2 and 3? Literally everything. Just kidding, Google it.Not sure what are these classes and objects things in Python? Google it. Your mind will be blown.Why am I getting this error message? If I told you I’d have to kill you. Not really, Google it.Why am I still getting this error message? Do I look like Google?You get the picture.This process can be annoying and frustrating and time-consuming. But recognize that in this endeavor you’re not just learning how to program. You’re learning how to teach yourself difficult concepts and solve stubborn problems—skills far more valuable than knowledge of any individual coding language.Very, very quickly Stack Overflow becomes your best friend, as does the online documentation for Python. At your fingertips you’ll discover tutorials, textbooks, and YouTube videos on everything from installing Python to building scalable web servers, from the basics of Python syntax to the most confusing data strucsures and algorithms.

      "content"  : "Here are links to some of my favorite commencement speeches, as well as notes for the three which have influenced me the most. Enjoy!YouTube Links to My Favorites  This is Water, David Foster Wallace  Make Good Art, Neil Gaiman  Make Your Bed, Admiral McRaven  Stanford 2005, Steve Jobs  Kenyon College 2016, John Green  USC 2017, Will Ferrell  Harvard 2003, Will Ferrell  Stanford Class Day 2013, Mehran Sahami  University of Texas 2020, Brene Brown  University of Houston 2015, Mathew McConaughey1. David Foster Wallace’s “This is Water”Delivered to the 2005 graduating class of Kenyon CollegeYouTube / Transcript  There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”Notes:The real value of a liberal arts education is not the familiar cliche of “teaching you how to think.” More subtly, its value instead lies in the option of what to think.Wallace asks the audience to consider a hypothetical conversation between an atheist and a Christian. These two characters discuss the atheist’s miraculous near-death experience and of course both come away with two completely different interpretations. These two differing interpretations remind us that our beliefs shape the way derive meaning from experience.It’s easy to let the analysis stop there. In doing so, however, we never consider how or why these men believe what they do.Too often we similarly ignore our own ability to choose what we believe. More personally, Wallace considers how often his arrogance keeps him from reflecting on his beliefs, how often he lives entrenched in erroneous blind certainties.Working the same tiring job, driving the same boring commute, day in and day out for years, many people slip into patterns of stress, anxiety, and anger. The loud annoying people in the supermarket are in my way. The slow, monotonous rush hour traffic becomes all about my fatigue and my need to get home. The experience of coming home from work is viewed through the unconscious, unacknowledged belief that in that moment everything is about myself.But this is a choice. A choice which could instead lead me to consider that the people in the supermarket are suffering just as much as me. Maybe the person who cut me off in traffic is in an even greater and more valid hurry than myself, and just maybe, it’s possible that I’m actually the one in his way.The insidious thing about self-centeredness and material desires is that these are the kinds of things you come to value gradually and unconsciously. Without even realizing it, you are increasingly selective about what you see and value and believe.The antidote is reminding yourself “this is water, this is water,” exerting the necessary effort to stay conscious and aware through the tedium and difficulty of adult existence.2. Neil Gaiman’s “Make Good Art”Delivered to the 2012 graduating class of the University of the ArtsYouTube /Transcript  I learned to write by writing. I tended to do anything as long as it felt like an adventure, and to stop when it felt like work, which meant that life did not feel like work.Notes:Gaiman didn’t go to University. He felt the need to write and put himself out into the world.He didn’t have a career plan. Just a list of things he wanted to do: “to write an adult novel, a children’s book, a comic, a movie, record an audiobook, write an episode of Doctor Who…”Gaiman gives the graduating class several pieces of advice:  Being young and knowing what is possible or impossible makes doing the impossible that much easier.  If you have an idea of what you were meant to do, then just do it. Gaiman conceptualizes his dream of being a great author as a distant mountain. At a crossroads, he’d ask himself which path would take him toward and which would take him away from that mountain.  You will have to deal with the painful problems of failure. To Gaiman, the life of a freelance artist “is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love.”  Make mistakes. They indicate that you’re doing something worth doing. And whatever misfortune presents itself in your life, just remember to make good art.  Furthermore, make your art. Make the art only you can make. If you start feeling like you’re walking naked down the street, then you’re on the right track.  As a freelancer you get hired however you can. You keep you job by a) doing good work, b) being easy to get along with, and c) getting your work in on time. According to Gaiman, if you think about it, you really only need to achieve any two of these three.  Enjoy the ride. Don’t worry too much.Finally, Gaiman concludes that if you don’t know what you’re doing, then pretend you are someone who is wise or competenet. Then just behave how that person would.3. Admiral William H. McRaven’s “Make Your Bed”Delivered to the 2014 graduating class of the University of Texas at AustinYouTube /Transcript  It’s been almost 37 years to the day that I graduated from UT. I remember a lot of things about that day. I remember I had throbbing headache from a party the night before. I remember I had a serious girlfriend, whom I later married — that’s important to remember by the way — and I remember that I was getting commissioned in the Navy that day.Notes:UT’s slogan is “What starts here changes the world.” McRaven points out that the effects of even small, simple decisions propagate across time and generations to have huge consequences. Indeed, this class of 8000 graduates has in their collective actions the potential to truly improve the world.He draws upon his experience in Navy SEAL training, giving the graduating class some advice for their coming journeys:  Make your bed. This habit reminds you that excellence in the little things of life matters. The made bed provides a small source of pride in the morning. And besides, no matter how terrible your day, at least you’ll come home to the encouragement of a bed you made for yourself.  You’ll need teamwork to change the world.  Measure people not by their appearance, but instead by their character.  Sometimes your best effort won’t prevent you from failing.  In fact, you will likely have to fail often and should not be afraid of failure.  Sometimes innovation requires courage in the face of risk and adversity.  Stand your ground to the bullies.  In the darkest moments, show your very best.  Hope, given to others in times of struggle, is an immensely powerful gift.  Never give up.",

      "content"  : "This was a course research project for CS 378H Computer Graphics Honors at UT Austin, which I completed in collaboration with my partner Rahul Krishnan. If you like this article, be sure to check out the project’s public GitHub repository.How It WorksTo create desert geometries, we simulated the physics of wind-blown sand particles. Additionally, to improve the realism of the images produced, we also implemented Catmull-Clark subdivision and procedurally generated noise.Physical SimulationHeight Map:We represent the desert floor as 2D grid of height values which we call the height map.At each time step of the simulation, the value at row i and column j of the map is updated with the following equation:where  is the number of particles deposited at that point,  is the number of particles leaving that point, and  is the diameter of any given particle.  is determined by particle collisions with the floor, while  is either 1 or 0 and determined with a pseudo random number generator.Particles:The particles are stored in a linked list. At each time step their individual velocities and positions are updated with the following equations:where the  is the force of gravity and  is the force of drag from the wind.A particle’s initial velocity is determined by the wind velocity and direction, while a particle’s initial position is the physical location of the height map point where it was born.Collision:When a particle collides with the floor, its velocity is attenuated and then redirected upwards.Then it can either stay alive and bounce if the magnitude of its resulting velocity is greater than some epsilon, or it can be deposited at that point in the floor otherwise.For more details regarding any aspect of the physical simulation we did please see Wang and Hu’s paper referenced below.Catmull-Clark SubdivisionThe physical simulation above resulted in a mesh which was very polygonal. You could see individual triangles like how models were rendered on old game consoles such as the N64. To fix this, we implemented the classic Catmull-Clark algorithm whereby a surface is recursively subdivided and made incrementally smoother. For example, this image taken from Wikipedia depicts a cube which is made to increasingly approximate a sphere:For a complete description of how the algorithm works, see the Wikipedia article mentioned above.Procedurally Generated NoiseTo add organic bumps and dune-like geometries to our desert, we implemented a form of noise generation whereby coarse noise is combined with upsampling increasingly finer grained noise. Graphically, the basics of this algorithm can be depicted simply:RenderingWe converted the polygonal mesh of the floor which results from the above algorithms into a triangular mesh which we rendered on the GPU using OpenGL.Example ImagesSand Simulation With Catmull-Clark:Procedural Noise With Sand Simulation and Catmull-Clark:Sand Simulation Without Catmull-Clark Subdivisions:Procedural Noise Without Sand Simulation:Referenced WorksThe physical simulation math and physics came from:Real-Time Simulation of Aeolian Sand Movement and Sand Ripple Evolution by Ning Wang and Bao-Gang Hu.",
